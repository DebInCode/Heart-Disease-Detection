# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning 🫀

This ML project predicts heart disease using patient data. It uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest, achieving 99.7% cross-validation accuracy with full evaluation metrics.

## 📊 Dataset
- UCI Heart Disease dataset
- 1025 samples, 13 features, 1 target (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression: 80.5% accuracy
- Random Forest: 100% test accuracy, 99.7% cross-validation accuracy

## 🧪 Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Cross-validation (5-fold)

## 💾 Files
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` – notebook
- `heart_rf_model.pkl` – saved Random Forest model
- `README.md` – project summary

## 🧠 Future Work
- Streamlit app deployment
